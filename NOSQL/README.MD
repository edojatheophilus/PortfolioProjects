AMAZON AND FLIPCART PRODUCT SCRAPPER

In this project, we have developed a Python script for scraping Amazon product links based 
on a given product name. Leveraging the requests library for HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup for 
HTML parsing, our script aims to facilitate efficient data retrieval from the Amazon website.
